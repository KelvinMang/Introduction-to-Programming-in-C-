## 1.Counter.cpp : 

Write a program that asks the user to enter a number of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies and then outputs the monetary value of the coins in the format of dollars and remaining cents.


Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the following example:


Please enter the number of coins:
no. of quarters: 20 <br />
no. of dimes: 4 <br />
no. of nickels: 13  <br />
no. of pennies: 17  <br />
The total is 6 dollars and 22 cents

## 2.coins.cpp 

Write a program that asks the user to enter an amount of money in the format of dollars and remaining cents. The program should calculate and print the minimum number of coins (quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies) that    are equivalent to the given amount.

Hint: In order to find the minimum number of coins, first find the maximum number of quarters that fit in the given amount of money, then find the maximum number of dimes that fit in the remaining amount, and so on.

For example, an execution should look like  this:
Please enter the amount of money to convert:<br />
no. of dollars: 2 <br />
no. of cents: 37  <br />
The coins are 9 quarters, 1 dimes, 0 nickels and 2 pennies

## 3.bmimetric.cpp

Body mass index (BMI) is a number calculated from  a person’s weight and height.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the BMI is a fairly
reliable indicator of body fatness for most people. BMI does not measure body fat
directly, but research has shown that  BMI correlates to direct  measures  of  body  fat,  
such  as  underwater  weighing  and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The formula 
for BMI is

    Weight/Heightˆ2

Where weight is in kilograms and height is in meters.


Write a program that prompts for metric weight and height and outputs the BMI with two decimal places.


For example,  an  execution could look  like  this: <br />
Please enter weight in kilograms: 50 <br />
Please enter height in meters: 1.58 <br />
BMI is: 20.03

## gradeclass.cpp
Write a program that inputs two grades separated by a space.  

If both grades are below a score of sixty then the program should output the message:

Student Failed:(

If both grades are greater than or equal to ninety five then the program should output the message:

Student Graduated with Honors:)

Otherwise the program should output the message:

Student Graduated!

For example, an execution could look like this:


Please enter 2 grades, separated by a space: 59 95

Student Graduated!
