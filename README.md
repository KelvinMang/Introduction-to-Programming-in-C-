Counter.cpp : 

Write a program that asks the user to enter a number of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies and then outputs the monetary value of the coins in the format of dollars and remaining cents.


Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the following example:


Please enter the number of coins:
no. of quarters: 20
no. of dimes: 4
no. of nickels: 13
no. of pennies: 17
The total is 6 dollars and 22 cents

coins.cpp 

Write a program that asks the user to enter an amount of money in the format of dollars and remaining cents. The program should calculate and print the minimum number of coins (quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies) that    are equivalent to the given amount.

Hint: In order to find the minimum number of coins, first find the maximum number of quarters that fit in the given amount of money, then find the maximum number of dimes that fit in the remaining amount, and so on.

For example, an execution should look like  this:
Please enter the amount of money to convert:

no. of dollars: 2
no. of cents: 37
The coins are 9 quarters, 1 dimes, 0 nickels and 2 pennies
